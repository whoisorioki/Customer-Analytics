Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.\n","\n","You've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.\n","\n","You've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution. The dataset contains anonymized student information, and whether they were looking for a new job or not during training:\n","\n","| Column                   | Description                                                                      |\n","|------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n","| `student_id`             | A unique ID for each student.                                                    |\n","| `city`                   | A code for the city the student lives in.                                        |\n","| `city_development_index` | A scaled development index for the city.                                         |\n","| `gender`                 | The student's gender.                                                            |\n","| `relevant_experience`    | An indicator of the student's work relevant experience.                          |\n","| `enrolled_university`    | The type of university course enrolled in (if any).                              |\n","| `education_level`        | The student's education level.                                                   |\n","| `major_discipline`       | The educational discipline of the student.                                       |\n","| `experience`             | The student's total work experience (in years).                                  |\n","| `company_size`           | The number of employees at the student's current employer.                       |\n","| `company_type`           | The type of company employing the student.                                       |\n","| `last_new_job`           | The number of years between the student's current and previous jobs.             |\n","| `training_hours`         | The number of hours of training completed.                                       |\n","| `job_change`             | An indicator of whether the student is looking for a new job (`1`) or not (`0`). |"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"eda9c1b2-4e9a-41ac-8da6-d4c98775f986","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":213,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","ds_jobs = pd.read_csv(\"customer_train.csv\")\n","\n","# View the dataset\n","ds_jobs.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"13757e62-aca2-48f4-b569-a838af11bdd5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a copy of ds_jobs for transforming\n","ds_jobs_transformed = ds_jobs.copy()\n","\n","ds_jobs_transformed.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7e544d52","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# EDA to help identify ordinal, nominal, and two-factor categories\n","for col in ds_jobs.select_dtypes(\"object\").columns:\n","    print(ds_jobs_transformed[col].value_counts(dropna=False), '\\n')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0ed8b581","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a dictionary of columns containing ordered categorical data\n","ordered_cats = {\n","    'enrolled_university': ['no_enrollment', 'Part time course', 'Full time course'],\n","    'education_level': ['Primary School', 'High School', 'Graduate', 'Masters', 'Phd'],\n","    'experience': ['<1'] + list(map(str, range(1, 21))) + ['>20'],\n","    'company_size': ['<10', '10-49', '50-99', '100-499', '500-999', '1000-4999', '5000-9999', '10000+'],\n","    'last_new_job': ['never', '1', '2', '3', '4', '>4']\n","}\n","\n","# Create a mapping dictionary of columns containing two-factor categories to convert to Booleans\n","two_factor_cats = {\n","    'relevant_experience': {'No relevant experience': False, 'Has relevant experience': True},\n","    'job_change': {0.0: False, 1.0: True}\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bdc99f92","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Loop through DataFrame columns to efficiently change data types\n","for col in ds_jobs_transformed:\n","    \n","    #
